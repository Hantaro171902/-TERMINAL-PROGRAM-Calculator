# 🧮 ASCII Calculator (C++ Terminal Program)

A simple calculator that runs entirely in the **terminal**, built with **C++ and OOP design**.  
The UI is rendered with ASCII art and ANSI escape codes, giving it a retro pocket-calculator feel ✨.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **ASCII UI** with calculator-like layout.  
- **Instant input**: no need to hit enter for every key.  
- **Button highlight animations** when pressed.
